    "Let us consider a linear elastic cylinder with an internal radius $R_{\\mathrm{in}}=R-t/2$ and external radius  $R_{\\mathrm{out}}=R+t/2$, where $R$ is the average radius and $t$ the thickness. The cylinder is sumbitted to an internal pressure $p_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and an external pressure $p_{\\mathrm{out}}$. We will denote by $E$ and $\\nu$ its Young modulus and Poisson ratio. We consider a 2D model for the cylinder modelling only its cross-section under plane-strain assumption.\n",

When using a finite element discretisation there is a numerical locking problem *(verrouillage numérique)* that strongly affects the convergence rate. In the following we try to put into evidence this problem and propose a solution based on a mixed variational formulation, introducing a splitting of the stress tensor into deviatoric and volumetric parts and the use of appropiate discretisations."
